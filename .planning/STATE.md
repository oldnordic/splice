# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Span-safe refactoring with validation
**Current focus:** Phase 12 - Rich Span Advanced (3 plans complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 17 (Rich Span Advanced)
Plan: 01 of 08 in current phase (1 completed)
Status: In progress - relationship query module complete
Last activity: 2026-01-22 — Completed plan 12-01: Relationship builder with caching and error codes

Progress: [██████████░░░░░░░░░░] 56%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 43 (31 v2.0 + 12 v2.2)
- Total plans planned: 80 (31 v2.0 + 49 v2.2)
- Average duration: ~29 min/plan (v2.0 baseline)
- Total execution time: ~25.4 hours (24h v2.0 + 1.4h v2.2)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1-10 (v2.0) | 31 | ~24h | ~31 min |
| 11-17 (v2.2) | 12/49 | 1.4h | ~7 min |
| **Total** | **43/80** | **~25.4h** | **~29 min** |

**Recent Trend:**
- v2.0 completed in ~2 days
- Baseline velocity established: ~31 min/plan
- v2.2 plans executing quickly (~4-7 min each)
- Phase 12 started: relationship query infrastructure complete
- Rich span metadata integrated into CLI JSON output

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: Comprehensive 10-phase overhaul for production readiness
- [v2.0]: SQLiteGraph v1.0 Native V2 backend migration
- [v2.2]: Additive schema only (all new fields optional for backward compatibility)
- [v2.2]: Foundation-first approach (error codes + output schema before features)
- [v2.2]: Combined milestone — original v2.1 UX improvements merged with Unified JSON Schema work
- [v2.2 Gap Closure]: Infrastructure-first strategy — build types/functions/tests first, then integrate into CLI
- [12-01]: Relationship query infrastructure stubbed - get_callers/get_callees return empty results until edge creation is implemented during code ingestion
- [12-01]: Session-based caching with RelationshipCache (HashMap key format: {rel_type}:{node_id_or_path})
- [12-01]: Phase 11 error code integration in Relationships struct (REL_QUERY_FAILED, NODE_NOT_FOUND, FILE_NOT_FOUND)

### Pending Todos

**Next Phase:**
- Continue executing Phase 12 plans (12-04 through 12-08)
- Integrate suggested actions into CLI JSON output schema

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Gap Closure (2026-01-22):**
- ✅ [Phase 11] Context infrastructure now integrated into CLI — --context-lines flag added, extract_context() called
- ✅ [Phase 11] Semantic kind infrastructure now integrated into CLI — fields populated via AnySymbol matching
- ✅ [Phase 11] Checksum infrastructure now integrated — checksum_before and file_checksum_before populated
- ✅ [Phase 11] Error code infrastructure now integrated — SpliceErrorCode converted to ErrorCode in CliErrorPayload

**All Phase 11 gaps resolved.**

**From Research:**
- [Phase 12]: Semantic kind mapping coverage — need comprehensive mapping of tree-sitter node types for all 7 languages
- [Phase 12]: LLM action taxonomy completeness — need survey of real LLM agents to see which JSON fields they use
- [Phase 12]: Performance testing on 10K+ file codebases to validate mitigation strategies

**Mitigation:**
- Use `/gsd:research-phase` before Phase 12 implementation
- Start with minimal semantic kind taxonomy, extend based on actual usage
- Prototype relationship indexing early in Phase 12
- Action composition for complex operations (avoid over-engineering)
